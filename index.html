                    This project is a proof-of-concept ray tracer program that uses the Vulkan API and a Monte-Carlo
                    path
                    tracing algorithm to render sphere primitives. The program features interactivity, allowing users to
                    move, scale, and change the material of objects in the scene, as well as edit material properties
                    such as albedo, roughness, and refractive index. The program also supports camera movement, enabling
                    different perspectives on the virtual environment.
                    <br><br>
                    This was written in preparation for my 4th year dissertation, where I tasked myself with producing a
                    more in-depth ray tracer which runs in parallel on the GPU.

                    This project is a Vulkan-based ray tracer, written in C++, that adapts an Nvidia DesignWorks Samples
                    tutorial. It uses the Khronos Group Vulkan extension VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline and employs a
                    Monte-Carlo path tracing technique, which is executed on the GPU using compute shaders. The path
                    tracing is implemented through the use of a closest hit shader, a ray generation shader, and a miss
                    shader. Additionally, it uses a bounding volume hierarchy acceleration structure, which is a
                    technique for efficiently traversing a large number of objects in a scene. Overall, the project is
                    designed to showcase the capabilities of the Vulkan API for real-time ray tracing and demonstrate
                    the use of advanced techniques for optimizing rendering performance through the use of GPU
                    processing.
                    <br><br>
                    This project was developed for use in my 4th year research project, it may continue development
                    either through this repository, or a new one.

                    This project served as my introduction to 3D modelling and design in Blender, additional, smaller
                    projects were also developed in Unreal Engine 5 and openGL. Included is the modelling and design
                    process of each component that makes up the scene, a long with a discussion of the lighting
                    configuration used.

                    This is an action-adventure game prototype that draws inspiration from popular titles in the genre,
                    such as Diablo and Path of Exile. The game features fierce enemies, powerful loot, and customizable
                    character armor rigging and spells. The loot system is tiered, and levels are carefully designed
                    with destructible objects to add realism to the gameplay. The player controller uses a hierarchical
                    state machine with various sub-states, while the user interface features health and mana globes, a
                    hotbar for selecting skills, and an inventory system for managing items. This prototype also
                    includes a medieval fantasy-themed outdoor environment with a castle, dungeon, and merchant NPC for
                    trading items.
                    <br><br>
                    This was built as a one time group project and will not be continuing development, although
                    derivative projects may be built in the future.

                    DrawDojo is a social media platform developed for a 3rd year group project. It features a real-time
                    interactive drawing tool that allows users to paint on the same canvas, as well as a live chat for
                    communication. Completed paintings are posted to a feed where users can like, comment, or iterate on
                    them. The platform also includes a profile feature that lists all of a user's posts in one place.
                    <br><br>
                    This project was designed with a unique identity in mind. Although it shares some similarities with
                    other social media platforms, such as Instagram, every aspect of DrawDojo, including the color
                    scheme, was carefully chosen to give it a distinct and memorable identity.
                    <br><br>
                    This platform was built using 2 decoupled pieces, the user interface, written in React and Typescript. And a backend, using express, mongoDB, socket.IO, and Docker.

                    This is a mini-project, mostly just to gain experience in javascript, and test p5.js. It generates a
                    group of points on a canvas, and generates the convex hull around those points. The user can add or
                    remove to the total number of points using a slider.
                    <br><br>
                    A convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that completely encloses a set of points. In other
                    words, if you imagine laying a piece of string around a group of points and then pulling it tight,
                    the resulting shape would be the convex hull.
                    <br><br>
                    The Graham scan algorithm, which is used in this project, is a popular algorithm for finding the
                    convex hull of a set of points in
                    2D space. It works by first finding the point with the lowest y-coordinate (or the leftmost point in
                    case of a tie), which must be a vertex of the convex hull. Then, it sorts all the remaining points
                    by their polar angle with respect to this anchor point, and removes any that would create a concave
                    angle if added to the hull. This is repeated until all the points have been added to the hull.
