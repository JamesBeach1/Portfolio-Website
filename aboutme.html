                <b>Education & Career Goals</b>
                <br><br>
                As a software engineer with hands-on experience at Clearwater Analytics and Kaluza, I have developed a
                strong foundation in modern software engineering practices. At Clearwater Analytics, I honed my skills
                in building and maintaining distributed systems using technologies such as Java, Kotlin, and AWS.
                Getting hands on with infrastructure design and implementing micro-services have been key aspects of my
                role, which also included automation and scaling of CI/CD pipelines using tools like Terraform and
                Jenkins. My time at Kaluza further strengthened my proficiency in agile methodologies and web
                application development with React and TypeScript.

                I am eager to work in an environment that encourages continuous learning and provides opportunities to
                tackle complex and impactful projects. I am open to various sectors within software engineering,
                including web and mobile development, with the goal of becoming a well-rounded engineer capable of
                addressing challenging problems and contributing to meaningful projects.

                With a solid background in object-oriented programming languages such as Java, C#, and Kotlin, I am
                excited to bring my expertise to a dynamic professional setting and continue expanding my skill set.

                <b>Hobbies & Interests</b>
                <br><br>
                In my free time, I enjoy:
            <ul>
                <li>Problem-solving and seeking out puzzles and challenges to test my skills.</li>
                <li>Learning new programming languages and exploring complex problems.</li>
                <li>Exploring the technical aspects of the VFX industry, such as light and fluid simulations, and
                    keeping up with advancements in the field.</li>
                <li>Spending time in nature, whether itâ€™s walking in the countryside or by the sea.</li>
                <li>Traveling and exploring new places, which broadens my perspective and inspires creativity.</li>
                <li>Being an avid movie-goer and exploring various genres and styles of film, which fuels my interest in
                    storytelling and visual aesthetics.</li>
                <li>Continuing to learn Mandarin, with the goal of achieving my HSK 1 certification shortly.</li>
                <li>Looking forward to diving more frequently as a certified PADI scuba diver, as circumstances allow.</li>
            </ul>

            I believe that engaging in these hobbies and interests outside of work is essential for maintaining a
            healthy work-life balance and keeping my creativity sharp.
