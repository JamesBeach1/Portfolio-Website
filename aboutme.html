                <b>Education & Career Goals</b>
                <br><br>
                As a recent Computer Science graduate, I have a strong foundation in software engineering principles and
                experience working on real-world projects. At Kaluza, I began developing experience using agile
                methodologies and gained proficiency in building large-scale web applications using React and
                Typescript. I then went on to apply my
                skills and experience in a more hands-on role and taking lead for DrawDojo, a large-scale university
                group project
                built using React and Typescript. During this same year, my third year at Heriot Watt, I was awarded the
                Heriot Watt Deputy Principle
                Award for achieving a minimum of 6 A grades out of the 8 modules I sat.
                <br><br>
                I hope to work in an environment that fosters continuous learning and growth, and allows me to work on
                interesting and impactful projects. I am open to different sectors within software engineering, whether
                it be web development, mobile development, or software engineering in general. My ultimate goal is to
                become a well-rounded software engineer who can tackle complex problems with ease and contribute to
                meaningful projects that make a positive impact on society.
                <br><br>
                With proficiency in various object-oriented programming languages such
                as Java, C#, and C++, I am excited to contribute to a professional environment and continue to build
                upon my skill set.
                <br><br>
                <b>Hobbies & Interests</b>
                <br><br>
                In my free time, I love problem solving and often find myself looking for puzzles or other problems to
                solve. I enjoy challenging myself and learning new things, whether it's a new programming language or a
                difficult riddle. I am also interested in subjects related to the VFX industry, not so much the design
                aspect, but the technical aspect such as light or fluid simulations, and enjoy learning about new
                advancements and techniques in the field.
                <br><br>
                Outside of the technical world, I also enjoy spending time in nature. I love taking walks through the
                countryside or by the sea, and I find it a great way to unwind after a long day. I have a
                passion for travel and exploring new places, and I am always looking for opportunities to see more of
                the world. I'm also a certified PADI scuba diver, although being a student has made it difficult to
                pursue this hobby as often as I'd like. Overall, I believe that pursuing hobbies and interests outside
                of work is important for maintaining a healthy work-life balance and for keeping my mind sharp and
                creative.
